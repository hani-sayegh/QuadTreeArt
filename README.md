## Overview
This tool takes an input image, computes the weighted mean color of each region, and recursively subdivides the image to generate a stylized, block-based reconstruction.  
Think of it as a simple quadtree-inspired image approximator.

## Built With
- **C**
- **Dependencies:** [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for rendering and window management, and [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for image loading.
